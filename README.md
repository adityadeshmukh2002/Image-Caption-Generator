# Image-Caption-Generator
This repository contains the code and resources for an Image Caption Generator project, implemented using Python and deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to automatically generate descriptive and meaningful captions for images.

Overview
Image caption generation combines computer vision and natural language processing to create textual descriptions for images. In this project, we leverage a deep learning architecture to analyze the visual content of images and generate coherent and contextually relevant captions.

Key Features
Data preprocessing: Includes techniques for loading and preprocessing image and caption data.
Model architecture: Utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for feature extraction and caption generation.
Training and evaluation: Provides code for training the model on the dataset and evaluating the generated captions against ground truth captions.
Caption generation: Enables generating captions for new, unseen images using the trained model.
Evaluation metrics: Includes code for evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

Usage
